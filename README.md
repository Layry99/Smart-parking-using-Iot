# Smart-parking-using-Iot

Overview of this project
A Smart Parking System functions as a helpful assistant for parking, employing specialized sensors to discern whether parking spots are available or occupied. 
These sensors communicate with an intelligent computer, like the Arduino, which in turn connects to a robust cloud-based system using Wi-Fi. 
The cloud system continually updates in real-time, informing individuals about the availability of parking spaces. 
Users can conveniently access this information through a user-friendly app or website on their phones or computers. 
It is comparable to having an intelligent companion guaranteeing a parking experience without the inconvenience of aimlessly circling around. 
This system not only enhances the efficiency of cities and public spaces but also contributes to environmental well-being by minimizing traffic congestion and reducing pollution. 
While there may be initial setup costs and an adjustment period for users, the ultimate result is a significantly simplified parking process.
